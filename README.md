ðŸŒŸ Open Thoughts: Curating the Best Open Reasoning Datasets
**Open Thoughts** is a community effort by DataComp and Bespoke Labs to curate the best open reasoning datasets. Our first goal is to create a reasoning dataset to train state-of-the-art small reasoning models that surpass DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B on math and code reasoning benchmarks.

AI Innovation
ðŸ§  Collaborative Effort
The project brings together researchers and engineers from prestigious institutions such as Stanford, UC Berkeley, UW, Bespoke Labs, Juelich Supercomputing Center, LAION, UCLA, UNC Chapel Hill, and Toyota Research Institute, focusing on building high-quality datasets for AI models.
